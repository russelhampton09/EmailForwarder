# RandomSiteFinder #

## Purpose ##

The app itself simply chains google searches to find something random, and then it emails it to someone on request. The real purpose of this app is to play around with python in a way that has a functional results.
I have only used python for one off scripts. This is the first time I have written an app using python, and handled things like life cycles as well as project structure.

## Techs Used ##

pip3-venv (apparently not included in python3 now)
flask
python3
aws beanstalk
flask-rest
flask-sqlalchemy
flask-marshmallow
A bunch of other random modules ubuntu now comes with in the global python space

I chose flask-alchemy because it simplified the management of the sql engine life cycle
## Envrionment ##
I used Ubuntu and visual studio code to do the work.
